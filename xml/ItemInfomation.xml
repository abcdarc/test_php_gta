There is a small reception located off the lobby where guests are invited to sit down whilst checking in.  Just behind the concierge desk is the bar.]]></Report><Report Type="general"><![CDATA[This is a lovely deluxe property with an excellent location and comes highly recommended.  It is a historical builiding and has some lovely original touches, eg the original lifts that were used which had no doors so you would simply step in them and step out.  These are still working but encased behind glass.  In fact, the entire hotel is like a museum and momento of the past.   jg/04/2008]]></Report></Reports><RoomCategories><RoomCategory Id="001:AMR:XXX:XXX:XXX:44040"><Description><![CDATA[Standard Single]]></Description><RoomDescription><![CDATA[The bedrooms are superb and as the hotel has only recently opened, they are in excellent condition.
